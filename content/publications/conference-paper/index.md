abstract: Technical interviews are a critical yet stressful step in the hiring process for computer science graduates, often hindered by limited access to practice opportunities. This formative qualitative study (n=20) explores whether a multimodal AI system can realistically simulate technical interviews and support confidence-building among candidates. Participants engaged with an AI-driven mock interview tool featuring whiteboarding tasks and real-time feedback. Many described the experience as realistic and helpful, noting increased confidence and improved articulation of problem-solving decisions. However, challenges with conversational flow and timing were noted. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-driven technical interviews as scalable and realistic preparation tools, suggesting that future research could explore variations in interviewer behavior and their potential effects on candidate preparation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This qualitative study (n=20) examines an AI-driven mock technical interview system, finding that participants perceived it as realistic and confidence-building while improving articulation of problem-solving. Results suggest AI interviews are a promising, scalable preparation tool despite remaining conversational challenges.
